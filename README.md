Thanks for downloading my Discord Rich Presence

In oder for this to work properly you need to got Discord Dev Portal create a bot go to Rich Presence > Art Asssets add to images name large and min

And then on line 7 in the client.lua you need to copy youre bots application id which is in the general information tab in Discord Dev Portal. 

Then for line 9 you put youre server number max people that can join there example "/10" or "/50".

Then for line 12 u can set whatever u want the text to be when u hover over the large image

Then for line 15 u can set whatever u want the text to be when u hover over the small image

And if you set everything up correctly congrats u have a working Discord Rich Presence.
